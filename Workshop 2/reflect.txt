1. 
The reason cents2 does not represent the value of price2 in cents is because
of the way floating point variables stores data.
cents2 value returns as 10.11999999... instead of 10.12 for that reason.

2.
In my solution, I made the variable int coins to represent the amount of coins
used. I will now use coins to represent the amount of $20 bills.
int excTaxBalance is the daily sales balance excluding tax in cents. 
coins = subTotal / 2000;
excTaxBalance = % 2000;
printf("Twenties %3d %9.4lf\n", coins, (float)excTaxBalance / 100);

3.
The first way would be to break down the total cents variable into two int variables:
one variable containing the dollar value, and one containing the cents value
using the division and modulus operator. 
For example:
Assuming:
int smallPrice = 1796;
int smallPriceDollars = smallPrice / 100;
int smallPriceCents = smallPrice % 100;
printf("Small Price: $%d.%d", smallPriceDollars, smallPriceCents);

The second way is simliar to the first way, but we don't have to breakdown
the variable into seperate variables. We can just use the division and 
modulus operator within the printf statement:
int smallPrice = 1796;
printf("Small Price: $%d.%d", smallPrice/100, smallPrice%100);

The third way is using Promotion. For example, i made a varible,
double price, and promoted smallPrice to a double so it can handle
the cash, and cents format. 
double price;
price = smallPrice;
printf("Small Price: %.2f", price / 100);
