1. I learned how to use Visual Studio 2022 to create basic C programs, and
learned how to utilize the 'printf' function from the stdio.h library 
to print all sorts of texts, and special characters ASCII encoded characters.

2. SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol, and I learned to use it to
connect to the Seneca Matrix server, and learned how to use the many different linux
commands to navigate through the server, compile programs, and submit my work.

3. SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) is a network protocol similar to SSH,
but it allows me to access and transfer files to different servers. I utilized
the SFTP to transfer my workshop files to the Seneca Matrix Server.
